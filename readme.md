<h1> Weather API</h1>
Weather API is my first python project for my portfolio. In it, I wrote a software able to fetch weather data from many cities. 
The data base I used was from www.openweathermap.org and it has over 200k cities worldwide. It's a pretty simple terminal based application in which you get asked to write the name of the city you want to know about and it gives you the current weather status for that location.
This was my first time using an API. </br> 
</br>
This project was based on a tutorial from the youtube channel TechWithTim. </br>
I used the requests framework to be able to fetch the data from the API.</br>
For safety reasons I have hidden the Open Weather Map's API_KEY.
